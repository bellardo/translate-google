Google Translate API for Free

The official Google Translate API is not awailable for free but there is a way around which you can use without having to pay the enterprise license fee.
The text can be translated from one language to another using the secret translate.googleapis.com API that is internally used by the Google Translate extension for Chrome and requires no authentication.

The actual API url is (example):

https://translate.googleapis.com/translate_a/single?client=gtx&sl=auto&tl=en&dt=t&q=hola

This call will translate “hola” word from autodetected language (auto) to english (en)

All language codes can be found https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/languages
